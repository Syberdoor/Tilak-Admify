# Tilak-Admify

This is a tool that creates an area on your desktop that allows drag and dorp into it and executes everything dropped via stored credentials.
I doubt it is useful to anyone but me (I searched for the existence of such a tool before and found nothing anywhere) so I did not upload all dependencies.
If private repositories were free it would not be public.

If you really really think you want this add it as an issue and I will contact you
